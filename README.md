## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The main idea is to have a collection of easy to extract interview katas and being able to deploy into codesandbox.io.

For achieving this goal, this repo is going to be a **Tool (Interview CLI)**, in which you are going to be able to choose a project (with or without test already resolved), or pick certain level of difficulty or duration criteria and the tool chooses a random kata and deploy it.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

For running this repository, you only need **Node Js**

### Installing

First, you need to download the project and install the packages
```
npm i
```
Second, inside the project folder you need to create a linksymb to be able to run the tool globally 
```
npm link
```
Third, go to another location (one folder back is enough) and check if the command **interview-tool** is available.

## üéà Usage and Extension <a name="usage"></a>

```
interview-tool -p {project-name} [--with-tests]
```

- **project-name**: Name of the folder/kata project inside the tool directory that you want to deploy.

- **--with-tests**: optional paramter to indicate that you want to deploy a project with tests already resolved, default value: **false**.

- [X] Already implemented

### Draft

```
interview-tool -d {difficulty-level} | -t {estimated-duration} [--with-tests]
```

Difficulty Levels:


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
