## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The main idea is to have a collection of easy to extract projects for using in different sandboxes, like codesandbox.io.

For achieving this goal, this repo is going to be a **tool**, in which you are going to be able to choose a project and certain level of difficulty for generating a ***zip file*** with the necessary folders to be copy into the sandbox and the correspondent statement.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### TBC
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For running this repository, you only need **Node Js**

```

```

## 🎈 Installing and Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Difficulty Levels:
 - easy (include the **test folder** and the **src folder** with index.js with the function firm in the **zip file**)
 - normal (include the structure and the config files but there is no content in the folders)

The use is very simple:

```
npm i
npm run zip {project-name} {difficulty-level} 
```

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add Github actions for running every little project tests.
