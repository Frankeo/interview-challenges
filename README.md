## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The main idea is to have a collection of easy to extract interview katas and being able to deploy into codesandbox.io.

For achieving this goal, this repo is going to be a **Tool (Interview CLI)**, in which you are going to be able to choose a project (with or without test already resolved), or pick certain level of difficulty or topic as criteria and the tool chooses a random kata and deploy it.
