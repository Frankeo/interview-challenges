## :mag: About <a name = "about"></a>

The main idea is to have a collection of easy to extract __interview code challenges__ and being able to deploy them into [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

The **CLI (interview-tool)** let you create a new project with the next [scaffolding](), so you don't start form scratch!

Also, let you add/save already started projects to your interview list, following this [criteria]().

All the projects into your **interview list** are able to be deploy! you have multiple [criteria selection](), even a random one for avoiding favoritism problems! ðŸ˜Ž

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

For using this CLI, needs to be installed:
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/node/v/interview-tool?style=for-the-badge)

### Installation

Only need to run 
```
npm install -g interview-tool
```
And that's it!! ðŸ¥³

### Debugging

- 1Âº Download the project and install the packages inside the project folder
```
cd interview-challenges/
npm i
```
- 2Âº Inside the project folder you need to create a **linksymb** to be able to run the tool globally 
```
npm link
```
- 3Âº Go to another location (one folder back is enough!) and check if the command **interview-tool** is available.

- 4Âº **That's all!** Your code changes are going to take effect over the commands executed by the tool! ðŸ¤“
